# Bootstrap_Portfolio

My Portfolio remade with Bootstrap to be clean and responsive

This portfolio uses a number of Bootstrap components in order to achieve a more responsive design. Some of the components are the Grid system, Navbars, Responsive Images, Forms, and Buttons.

The goal of the use of Bootstrap was to achieve a better look on a variety of screen sizes, as well as to familiarize myself with what the library has to offer.
